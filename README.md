# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the `tic-tac-toe` game with the following features:

- `Reset Button`: After the game finishes and a winner is determined or there is a draw, a "Reset" button is displayed on the user interface. Clicking this button will reset the game and clear the board.

- `Background Color Change`: On clicking the `card` button, the background color properties are changed.

- `Turn Display`: The game indicates whose turn it is by displaying a `Circle` and `Cross` turn on the user interface. This helps the players keep track of whose turn it is during the game.

- `Winner Message`: When a player wins the game, a winner message is displayed on the user interface. The message likely states which player won, such as `Player X wins!` or `Player O wins!`

- `Draw Message`: If the game ends in a draw (no player wins), a draw message is displayed on the user interface. This message indicates that the game resulted in a tie or draw.

- `Dynamic Icon Display`: The user interface dynamically displays the `Circle` and `Cross` icons based on the player's moves. This means that as players take turns and make their moves on the game board, the appropriate icon (circle or cross) is displayed in the corresponding cell.

- `Responsive Design`: The game incorporates a responsive design, which means that it is designed to adapt and provide an optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes. This ensures that the game is playable and visually appealing on various devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

Overall, this implementation of tic-tac-toe includes game mechanics such as resetting, turn tracking, winner determination, draw detection, dynamic icon display, and a responsive user interface to enhance the gaming experience.
